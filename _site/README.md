# Security and Privacy deadlines countdown

Based on [ai-deadlines](https://aideadlin.es) by @abshkdz

## Adding/updating a conference

* Read the data format description below. **Note that the timezone format sign is inverted** (e.g., UTC+7 is written as `Etc/GMT-7`). It's [not a bug][0]. I hate this format too. I'd be happy to move to a different timezone JavaScript library that uses a friendlier format, but I don't have time for that.
* Update `_data/conferences.yml`. You can do that on Github or locally after forking the repo.
* Send a pull request

Fields marked with asterisk (\*) are required.


### Deadline format

The *deadline* field can contain:

1. The simplest option: a date and time in ISO format. Example: `"2017-08-19 23:59"`.
2. If a deadline is rolling, you can use a template date, just substitute the year with `%y`, or month with `%m`. Example: `"%y-%m-15 23:59"` means there is a deadline on the 15th day of every month, every year. `"2017-%m-15"` means a deadline on 15th day of every month, but only in 2017, i.e. `"2018-01-15"` is not a part of this template.
2. A list of (1) or (2). Example of two rolling deadlines, with one in the end of May every year, and the second in the end of February:
  ```
  - "%y-05-31 23:59"
  - "%y-02-28 23:59"
  ```

On the page, all deadlines are displayed in viewer's local time (that's a feature).

*Note:* If the deadline hour is `{h}:00`, it will be automatically translated into `{h-1}:59:59` to avoid pain and confusion when it happens to be midnight in local time.

### Timezones

The timezone is specified in [tz format][1]. Unlike abbreviations (e.g. EST), these are un-ambiguous. Here are tz codes for some common timezones:

| Common name                   | tz                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UTC                           | `Etc/UTC`                                                          |
| America Pacific Time          | `America/Los_Angeles`                                              |
| Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8) | `Etc/GMT+8` (Yes, the sign is inverted for some weird reason)      |
| America Eastern Time          | `America/New_York`                                                 |
| Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5) | `Etc/GMT+5`                                                        |
| American Samoa Time (UTC-11)  | `Pacific/Samoa` or `Etc/GMT+11`. This timezone does not use DST.   |
| Aleutian Islands              | `America/Adak`                                                     |
